# Calculator 

Interactive webpage where a user can solve expressions on a very basic calculator. Supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All decimals are rounded to the thousandths place.  Expressions can either be entered by clicking with the mouse or typing with a keyboard.

Note: the logic is not perfect and there may be some bugs that have gone unnoticed by me when testing.
